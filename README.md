# Trello Squadification

This is a Chrome browser extension to do self-selection in Trello.

## Installation

The easiest way to install the extension is via the Chrome web store.

To install from here download the folder and create a zip archive. Then open

`chrome:://extensions`

in your Chrome browser and drag'n'drop the zip archive there. Make sure to enable developer extensions.

## Usage

Every board containing a _Squadification Constraints_ list is recognized
by the extension.

Lists with a title containing an asterisk (*) will be ignored (that is
constraints will not be applied and no styling will be done).

For more information see the project's GitHub wiki pages.
